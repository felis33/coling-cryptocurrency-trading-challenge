Sentiment analysis divides market opinions into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. A positive sentiment signals optimism about future prospects, often leading to increased buying activity, while negative sentiment reflects pessimism, 
                        likely causing selling pressures. Neutral sentiment indicates either uncertainty or a balanced view, suggesting that investors are neither overly bullish nor bearish. Leveraging these sentiment indicators enables investors and analysts to fine-tune their strategies to better match the prevailing market atmosphere.
                        Additionally, news about competitors can significantly impact a company's cryptocurrency price. For example, if a competitor unveils a groundbreaking product, it may lead to a decline in the cryptocurrency prices of other companies within the same industry as investors anticipate potential market share losses.
